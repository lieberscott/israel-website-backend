    text: "So-called 'critics' of Israel launched an online movement to declare 'I'm not fuckin' dying for Israel' when Israel threatened and eventually launched its attack destroying Iran's nuclear weapons and eliminating its senior officers,' implying WW3 was coming and Israel runs American foreign policy. But when America signed a security commitment with Qatar three months later, promising 'the United States will take all legal and appropriate measures - including diplomatic, economic, and if necessary, military,' against anyone who attacks Qatar, these same voices never said 'I'm not fuckin' dying for Qatar.' And this security arrangemnet with Qatar, the U.S. doesn't even have with Israel.",
