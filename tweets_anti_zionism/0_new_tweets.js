1. One-state soltuion
2. "There's no Hamas in the West Bank"
3. No one supports Hamas, they just support Palestinian freedom
4. "Jihad means struggle, it's not violent"/"Intifada means uprising, it's not violent"
5. Anti-Zionist Jews
- There were pro-Hitler Jews too, and pro-Stalin Jews
- they are caught up in the same pressures and mind-viruses that non-Jews are
6. International Law
- Right of Return
- Settlements
- Humanitarian aid
- Palestinians violating international law



1. Anti-Zionism is a totalizing logic that shuts out contradiction. The movement casts Jewish national self-determination as the root cause of global injustice.
- Person in Nigeria telling them they should pray for Gaza
- Ven diagram with everything (white supremacy, genocide, climate chagne, etc.) being blamed on Zionism
- Mamdani: boots of NYPD were laced by IDF 


2. The hate is self-justifying, creating moral hysteria
- Jewish person gets assaulted: "Yeah but that's nothing compared to what's happening in Gaza"
- Fake picture of dead child "Yeah but they still exist"
- Email denying an Israeli person access to spa weekend, signed "Kindly" (also No. 3)

3. The difference this time: The hate is wrapped in the language of compassion and social justice
- Email denying an Israeli person access to spa weekend, signed "Kindly" (also No. 2)

4. Libels that can't be refuted
- BBC directs its journlaists to blame Israel for any food shortages regardless of facts
- 


5. Anti-Zionism echoes practices of Naziism
- "Making lists"
- No Jews allowed/No Israeli prodcuts allowed/No Zionists allowed
- Blocking Jewish students from reaching classes on campuses


6. Anti-Zionism rejects/rewrites Jewish history
- Ann Frank Memorial descecration
- Rejects that Jews were indigenous to the area despite (sewer manhole cover that says British Palestine but also "Land of Israel")



-------

1. Anti-Zionism is intimidating, echoes of Naziism
2. Anti-Zionism is violent
- Murder of Jews in Boulder marching in the run for their lives by molotov cocktail
- 
2. Examples of hate
- "Cry more bitch"
- Tearing down hostage posters (should be its own subcategory perhaps)
- 




2. Lies
3. Palestinians don't want to live peacefully
4. Palestinian culture is evil
5. 
5. NGOs




1. anti-Jewish libels spread through society: Racism begins with a presumption of guilt: Irrational hatred of who people are is recast as moral outrage over what they have allegedly done
- "Stop killing babies"
- al-Ahli hospital bombing
- Claims of deliberate starvation
- Allegations of civilian targeting
- The genocide libel



3. and rapidly recode entire ideological systems: the movement casts Jewish national self-determination as the root cause of global injustice. 
- greta thunberg switching from climate to palestinianism
- nypd boots are laced by the idf
- everything is palestinianism (climate change, white supremacy, workers rights, etc.)
- yeah, but whatever that person has to deal with is nothing compared to what they're dealing with in gaza
- NGO person telling a starving child in Nigeria he should pray for Gaza


4. the hatred and slanders are self-justifying


5. using the language of social justice, compassion, and kindness
- email from spa woman signed "kindly"


6. moral certainty

7. reshape institutions in their path

8. Their power does not comes from repetition, outrage, and a totalizing logic that shuts out contradiction

9. Anti-Zionism is hatred not of Jewish people individually -- although that partially exists too -- but hostility of Jewish peoplehood: It is precisely this collective soul—the idea of the Jewish people as a moral and metaphysical unity—that anti-Zionist ideology seeks to subvert.

10. They deny the reality of Jewish peoplehood and replace it with a false moral code of accusation—one that symbolically recasts Jewish collective identity as a singular threat to justice.
- Example 000000007E: pro-Palestinian protestor is against a Jewish state but has no problem with Islamic states

11. Anti-Zionist discrimination: marking anyone as a Zionist—regardless of their own identification or understanding—and treating them unequally on that basis.
- Mamdani's threat to shut down Technion's NYC campus falls under this rubric


Adding my own:
12. They're full of hate
13. Anti-Zionism is intimdating, fascistic, and violent, 



1. Add keyword's to front end and back end
2. Add support for 'nodate'
- should be a separate section/page

Claim: Rhetorical games
- Example 000000007E: pro-Palestinian protestor is against a Jewish state but has no problem with Islamic states
- 000000007F: TUcker Carlson saying we should stop talking about Israel so much, followed by him talking about Israel non-stop
- Ana Kasparian saying shut the fuck up about American politics to Eylon Levy while insisting Americans have a right to criticize Israel/Netanyahu
- They say the most horrific shit about us, then wish us a "Happy Hannukah" to prove they're not against Jews

Claim: Palestinian society is perversely evil
Claim: Palestinians do not want to live in peaceful coexistence
- videos
- polls/surveys

Claim: anti-Zionism is the new Naziism
- Nazis preventing Jews from entering college campus and then same thing happening on Columbia
- No Jews allowed; no Israeli products allowed
- Two Israelis killed while killer yelled 'Free Palestine'

Claim: Media launders lies, is pro-Hamas and anti-Israel
- BBC had to correct 2 stories per week about Israel
- al-Alhi lie with a NY Times showing a building that wasn't even the hospital 
- thin child on front page of NY Times who had cerebral palsy [starvation]



Lies:
- Genocide lie, compare pictures of fat Gazans with starved [genocide]


--

Media lies from al-Ahli

Rashida Tlaib still referencing the al-Ahli 'massacre' despite evidence it was a PIJ rocket

    text: "Gazan doctors from al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City staged a press conference at a fake massacre site. On Oct. 16, 2023, reports came out that Israel had bombed al-Alhi hospital, killing 500 people. The media ran with it. The NY Times, AP, Reuters, Guardian, and LA Times all had it prominantly in their publications. The LA Times ran a front-page headline: 'At least 500 killed in Israeli airstrike on Gaza City Hospital, Gaza Healthy Ministry says'. In reality, an errant Palestinian Islamic Jihad rocket hit the hospital parking lot, as demonstrated in subsequent days by video footage, intercepted calls between Palestinian groups, and multiple independent open-source intel analaysts. The hospital itself was fully in tact and operational. And there were less than 10 killed. (See other example Tweets from around this date on this site for more details.) Nevertheless, these 'trusted,' 'elevated,' 'professional' doctors staged a fake press conference before corpses, calling the event a massacre. Many more examples of lies stemming from this incident, click nearby dates to see more.",
