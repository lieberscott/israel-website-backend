    text: "Palestinian writer Randa Abdel-Fattah was canceled from the Adelaide Festival for supporting 10/7 and saying Zionists shouldn't feel safe anywhere. She also tried to get Jewish writer Thomas Friedman canceled from a previous festival. ABC in Australia lying through omission. Again. They’re now claiming terror-supporting Randa Abdel-Fattah was ‘cancelled for criticising Israel and Zionism’, while conveniently leaving out what she actually said: celebrating Oct 7 and declaring that Zionists shouldn’t feel safe anywhere. They also neglect to mention that Abdel-Fattah herself tried to get Jewish writers cancelled.",
