- Yom Kippur synogogue ramming in UK

Rhetorical games:
1. Mehdi Hasan, while spreading blood libels daily, 'condemns' (to act like the incident isn't linked to rhetoric like his) an attack on a synogague
), Dec 8, 2023: "“A man fired a shotgun into the air outside an Albany, N.Y., synagogue on Thursday afternoon and later said, 'Free Palestine,' according to the police… hours before the beginning of Hanukkah.” Horrible. Scary. Just plain wrong, bigoted, and antisemitic." [Links to New York Times article].
https://x.com/mehdirhasan/status/1733211524338950471


2. Mehdi Hasan saying that Israel wouldn't want to save hostages at the exact moment they were doing a hostage saving operation

3. Ilhan Omar wishing Jewish community Happy Hannukah while spreading blood libels

4. Rashida Tlaib wishing the Jewish community Happy Hannukah while spreading blood libels

----
5. Pro-Palestinians disrupting the yearly March that Jews do at a Holocaust site



0. Add all the list of Pal lies to your new lists

1. Islam takeover of the West
- Muslim preachers saying they want to take over Europe/America
- Individuals saying they will outbreed us

2. Muslim evil/violence
- Muslim rapes
- Arabs were 59% of all crime in Denmark (or somewhere like that)

3. Israeli innovation/tech/contributions to society (and America)

4. They want their children to die for propoganda purposes

4a. Propoganda
- Gazawood
- Add list of Pal lies to your current lists
- Go through your list of Pal lies and add propoganda category to them where appropriate (Mohammad Nazal and the fake broken arms story)

5. NGOs

6. Experts

7. How all the libels started even before 10/7. It was a genocide even before the recent war.

8. Insane lies (Israel dolphin- and other animal-trained Zionist conspiracies)

New category: Palestinianism is about destroying
- Person in NYC kicking in window at NYC subway station


- How they've been calling it a famine since three days after the war started and every few months since (Eyal Yakoby may have had a tweet about this)

1. Antagonize weak politicians who are swayed by the language of compassion and seek to appease
2. Their hate for Israel/Zionism is SO intense because Israel is such a clear example that demonstrates the failure of their ideology
- being against white/rich/capitalist and for brown/oppressed/violent, otherwise you're racist
- the angrier and more violent brown people are against white people, the more it proves how oppressed they are by white people (rather than just their religion/culture/history being radical and violent, which would be racist to think or perpetrate)
3. Just as the modern left doesn't march or care when blacks kill other blacks and only when a white person (or a police officer) kills a black person, they.  dnot care when Hamas kills other Palestinians, or, more broadly, when Arabs kill other Arabs. Only when Israel (white colonizers) kill Palestinians, no matter the circumstances. Thisis again because of ideology — white/brown, capitalist/poor, 
4. The Iranian Revolution had the green-red alliance, and it fell apart after the revolution


1. Demonstrate the Nakhba was started by the Plaestinians,
2. This was not a situation when no other options are available so they must resort to violence. Palestinians reject peaceful coexistence.
3. It's not a righteous call for peace and liberation. It's about Islam/history/culture. They want the whole area. They want to exert violence on kuffars.
- and what their resistence looks like is beyond evil
4. The history (from Sword and Scimitar)





New schemas
- Deep Dives
- Atrocity Denial: Links to newspaper clippings about 10/7 rapes, and people below them all denying it




5. Antizionist Jews
- There were pro-Hitler Jews too, and pro-Stalin Jews
- they are caught up in the same pressures and mind-viruses that non-Jews are
6. International Law
- Right of Return
- Settlements
- Humanitarian aid
- Palestinians violating international law



1. Antizionism is a totalizing logic that shuts out contradiction. The movement casts Jewish national self-determination as the root cause of global injustice.
- Person in Nigeria telling them they should pray for Gaza
- Ven diagram with everything (white supremacy, genocide, climate chagne, etc.) being blamed on Zionism
- Mamdani: boots of NYPD were laced by IDF 


2. The hate is self-justifying, creating moral hysteria
- Jewish person gets assaulted: "Yeah but that's nothing compared to what's happening in Gaza"
- Fake picture of dead child "Yeah but they still exist"
- Email denying an Israeli person access to spa weekend, signed "Kindly" (also No. 3)

3. The difference this time: The hate is wrapped in the language of compassion and social justice
- Email denying an Israeli person access to spa weekend, signed "Kindly" (also No. 2)

4. Libels that can't be refuted
- BBC directs its journlaists to blame Israel for any food shortages regardless of facts
- 


5. Antizionism echoes practices of Naziism
- "Making lists"
- No Jews allowed/No Israeli prodcuts allowed/No Zionists allowed
- Blocking Jewish students from reaching classes on campuses


6. Antizionism rejects/rewrites Jewish history
- Ann Frank Memorial descecration
- Rejects that Jews were indigenous to the area despite (sewer manhole cover that says British Palestine but also "Land of Israel")



-------

1. Antizionism is intimidating, echoes of Naziism
2. Antizionism is violent
- Murder of Jews in Boulder marching in the run for their lives by molotov cocktail
- 
2. Examples of hate
- Tearing down hostage posters (should be its own subcategory perhaps)


2. Lies
- Claiming that Yemen's leadership was killed by Israel (prime minister, etc.) when they took out the Houthi leadership
3. Muslims claim everything as their own
- Mehdi Hasan says Muslims built Amewrica as slaves (1 in 3 were slaves)
- Jesus was a Palestinian/Muslim





1. anti-Jewish libels spread through society: Racism begins with a presumption of guilt: Irrational hatred of who people are is recast as moral outrage over what they have allegedly done
- "Stop killing babies"
- al-Ahli hospital bombing
- Claims of deliberate starvation
- Allegations of civilian targeting
- The genocide libel



3. and rapidly recode entire ideological systems: the movement casts Jewish national self-determination as the root cause of global injustice. 
- greta thunberg switching from climate to palestinianism
- nypd boots are laced by the idf
- everything is palestinianism (climate change, white supremacy, workers rights, etc.)
- yeah, but whatever that person has to deal with is nothing compared to what they're dealing with in gaza
- NGO person telling a starving child in Nigeria he should pray for Gaza


4. the hatred and slanders are self-justifying


5. using the language of social justice, compassion, and kindness
- email from spa woman signed "kindly"


6. moral certainty

7. reshape institutions in their path

8. Their power does not comes from repetition, outrage, and a totalizing logic that shuts out contradiction

9. Antizionism is hatred not of Jewish people individually -- although that partially exists too -- but hostility of Jewish peoplehood: It is precisely this collective soul—the idea of the Jewish people as a moral and metaphysical unity—that antizionist ideology seeks to subvert.

10. They deny the reality of Jewish peoplehood and replace it with a false moral code of accusation—one that symbolically recasts Jewish collective identity as a singular threat to justice.
- Example 000000007E: pro-Palestinian protestor is against a Jewish state but has no problem with Islamic states

11. Antizionist discrimination: marking anyone as a Zionist—regardless of their own identification or understanding—and treating them unequally on that basis.
- Mamdani's threat to shut down Technion's NYC campus falls under this rubric


Adding my own:
12. They're full of hate
13. Antizionism is intimdating, fascistic, and violent, 



1. Add keyword's to front end and back end
2. Add support for 'nodate'
- should be a separate section/page

Claim: Rhetorical games
- Example 000000007E: pro-Palestinian protestor is against a Jewish state but has no problem with Islamic states
- 000000007F: TUcker Carlson saying we should stop talking about Israel so much, followed by him talking about Israel non-stop
- Ana Kasparian saying shut the fuck up about American politics to Eylon Levy while insisting Americans have a right to criticize Israel/Netanyahu
- They say the most horrific shit about us, then wish us a "Happy Hannukah" to prove they're not against Jews


Claim: antizionism is the new Naziism
- Nazis preventing Jews from entering college campus and then same thing happening on Columbia
- No Jews allowed; no Israeli products allowed
- Two Israelis killed while killer yelled 'Free Palestine'

Claim: Media launders lies, is pro-Hamas and anti-Israel
- BBC had to correct 2 stories per week about Israel
- al-Alhi lie with a NY Times showing a building that wasn't even the hospital 
- thin child on front page of NY Times who had cerebral palsy [starvation]



Lies:
- Genocide lie, compare pictures of fat Gazans with starved [genocide]


--

Media lies from al-Ahli

Rashida Tlaib still referencing the al-Ahli 'massacre' despite evidence it was a PIJ rocket

    text: "Gazan doctors from al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City staged a press conference at a fake massacre site. On Oct. 16, 2023, reports came out that Israel had bombed al-Alhi hospital, killing 500 people. The media ran with it. The NY Times, AP, Reuters, Guardian, and LA Times all had it prominantly in their publications. The LA Times ran a front-page headline: 'At least 500 killed in Israeli airstrike on Gaza City Hospital, Gaza Healthy Ministry says'. In reality, an errant Palestinian Islamic Jihad rocket hit the hospital parking lot, as demonstrated in subsequent days by video footage, intercepted calls between Palestinian groups, and multiple independent open-source intel analaysts. The hospital itself was fully in tact and operational. And there were less than 10 killed. (See other example Tweets from around this date on this site for more details.) Nevertheless, these 'trusted,' 'elevated,' 'professional' doctors staged a fake press conference before corpses, calling the event a massacre.
