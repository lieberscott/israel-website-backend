    text: "From Haaretz (link in reply): 'Hamas avoids releasing information about those killed among its military wing...For Gaza residents, the censorship of the identity of the dead Hamas  members has created a complex situation, with clear unwritten rules.  Several of them have told Haaretz that the enormous fear of these rules  make their enforcement unnecessary...'There is fear of speaking in public about Hamas members, even ones who  were killed, for many reasons,'' said Assam (a pseudonym, as are the  names of all the interviewees in this article)....Assam confirms that the unofficial code of silence has grown much more  powerful since the war broke out...People pass on information about the deaths  mostly by word of mouth. 'Hamas releases the names of the  organization's dead' only in rarest of cases, he said. 'The population  doesn't post them, not even the families.'...The ban on publishing the names of the dead Hamas combatants is an  important part of this maneuvering. 'The common assumption on the street is that if they publish the names of dead militants, the world will  identify less with the Gazans' suffering,' Adnan said. 'That will legitimize bombing Gaza. As long as there are videos and stories about  the civilian population, no one says anything. But if someone dares  criticize Hamas or mentions the name of a dead militant, they'll call  him a ''traitor' and treat him that way.'...the fear is so great that 'sometimes relatives who aren't  involved themselves don't know their relatives died. She added: 'The  situation is so murky that family members often join the Hamas military  wing without their parents' knowledge. They learn of their death only  through rumors. The families are uprooted and move from place to place.  Their children who are Hamas members leave home without leaving a  message as to their whereabouts. The report that they were killed  travels via word of mouth until it reaches the parents.'",
