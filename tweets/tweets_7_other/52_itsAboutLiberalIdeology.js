Just as the modern left doesn't march or care when blacks kill other blacks and only when a white person (or a police officer) kills a black person, they.  dnot care when Hamas kills other Palestinians, or, more broadly, when Arabs kill other Arabs. Only when Israel (white colonizers) kill Palestinians, no matter the circumstances. This is again because of ideology — white/brown, capitalist/poor, ",
