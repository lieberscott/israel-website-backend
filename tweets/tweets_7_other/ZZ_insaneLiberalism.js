On the Right, reactions to the Renee Good shooting have largely been contextual -- explaining the circumstances around interference with law enforcement. There’s no mass celebration of her death. Cause and effect analysis. Contrast that with the response to Charlie Kirk from the Left. Open celebration. Memes. Dances. “Rest in piss” posts. People losing jobs because they couldn’t help themselves. That wasn’t fringe behavior -- it was loud, public, and revealing. Until that asymmetry is acknowledged, you're going to have a really hard time calling for trying to 'go back'. It smells like an attempt to paper over a problem everyone can see clearly now.'",
