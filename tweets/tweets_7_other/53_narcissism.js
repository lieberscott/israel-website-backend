    text: "Columbia Ph.D. Johannah King-Slutzky, studying “theories of the imagination and poetry as interpreted through a Marxian lens” (seriously), wants “humanitarian aid” while she and her fellow revolutionairies board up the campus building. People in actual war zones are being raped, enslaved, murdered, fighting in wars, and dying of starvation across the world. Johannah has a warm bed to sleep in, a campus canteen, running water, sanitation, and countless luxuries that those in war zones would give anything for. She's not a revolutionary. She's entitled, out of touch, and desperate to make her life have value.",
