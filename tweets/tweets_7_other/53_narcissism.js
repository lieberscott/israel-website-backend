  claimText: "Insane Liberalism (https://x.com/newstart_2024/status/2009348130513309818):'Left-wing authoritarianism is almost identical to narcissism  Entitlement (“we decide what you can say”), grandiosity (“we’re the good people”), and psychopathy (“we don’t care about the harm we cause”).' (https://x.com/drdina1/status/2010409714522148880): Not all leftists are narcissists, but the leftist movement definitely appeals to those with Cluster-B personality disorders, including narcissism.  It also resonates with histrionics (needy of attention; hypersexual), as well as those with anti-social personality disorder (let's steal and destroy stuff) and borderline personality disorder (narcissistic + manipulative + tendency to fixate). This is why it's usually futile to try to pull them away from the leftist movement using facts and logic. One side elevates their weaknesses and neuroses and tells them it makes them special. The other side demands evidence, encourages behaviors that genuinely strengthen individuals and the group, and expects personal accountability. No contest. (https://x.com/TheAliceSmith/status/2010302212967416093): There’s a straight line between narcissistic personality disorder and the leftist mindset: always right, morally superior, everything about them, save the world, performative actions, fantasy over reality, all opponents are evil, the anointed ones.",
